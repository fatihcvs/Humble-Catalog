Pulls every distinct item name, author, narrator, genre, series,

spreadsheets, then searches all non-data files in the repo for them.
Exits 1 on any hit not on the allowlist below.

Contains no personal data itself — everything is read at runtime.

# equals this string" -- so the list is a cost, paid only where there is
# no alternative. Two things keep it from growing:
#
# - A single ordinary English word never needs an entry. COMMON_ZIPF
#   below exempts it automatically; 50 entries were removed on
#   2026-09-20 when that rule arrived, because it covered them.
# - A fresh collision in the working tree is REWORDED, not added here.
#   An entry earns its place only when rewording is impossible, which in
#   practice means the text is already in pushed history.
#
# Entries record why they are benign and never what kind of catalog term
# they collided with: naming the role turns a weak signal into a usable
# one. For the same reason, nothing here is grouped by category.

# Ordinary single words are not disclosures.
#
# The term set is derived from the live catalog, so it grows as the
# library does, and a perfectly good English word becomes forbidden the
# moment some term happens to equal it -- retroactively, in code that was
# clean when it was written. Writing each one into ALLOWED instead
# published a little more of the library every time: 71 of its 79 entries
# were catalog terms when this was added.
#
# So a single token that is common English is exempt. A lone common word
# cannot reconstruct anything, and is indistinguishable from the same
# word used as itself -- which is exactly what makes it weak.
#
# SINGLE TOKENS ONLY, whatever the score. wordfreq will happily rate a
# phrase by combining its tokens, which rates a three-common-word title
# like any other three common words; a phrase can name exactly one work,
# so no phrase is ever exempt. See the design doc:
# docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-20-leak-check-common-words-design.md
#
# Calibrated 2026-09-20, and chosen from a gap rather than by taste. The
# single-word entries this list had accumulated fall into two groups with
# nothing between them: four brand names at 1.64 and below, and fifty
# ordinary words at 2.96 and above. 2.9 is the highest value that covers
# all fifty, and it sits in the middle of a band 1.3 wide, so a small
# wordfreq shift cannot move the boundary. At this value 161 of the 386
# single-word terms the catalog holds are exempt -- 2.8% of the 5,675
# terms in the raw set, and the number a run reports.
#
# Re-run the calibration in the design doc when upgrading wordfreq;
# tests/test_leak_check.py pins scores either side of this value so a
# bump cannot move the gate quietly.
